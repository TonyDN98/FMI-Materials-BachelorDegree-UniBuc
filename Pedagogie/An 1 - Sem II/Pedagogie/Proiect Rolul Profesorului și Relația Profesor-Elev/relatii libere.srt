1
00:-05:-36,-340 --> 00:-05:-34,-710
- Whaddup everyone,
it's yo girl Superwoman

2
00:-05:-34,-710 --> 00:-05:-32,-850
you know once upon my
life, I was productive

3
00:-05:-32,-850 --> 00:-05:-31,-430
and I went to school, and honestly,

4
00:-05:-31,-430 --> 00:-05:-30,-410
although it's been a few years,

5
00:-05:-30,-410 --> 00:-05:-29,-136
I will never forget the teachers

6
00:-05:-29,-136 --> 00:-05:-26,-340
that took the time to educate me.

7
00:-05:-26,-340 --> 00:-05:-24,-850
Those teachers that put in that little bit

8
00:-05:-24,-850 --> 00:-05:-22,-860
of extra effort to help me succeed.

9
00:-05:-22,-860 --> 00:-05:-20,-550
The teachers that recognized
my special skills,

10
00:-05:-20,-550 --> 00:-05:-18,-990
and encouraged me to succeed.

11
00:-05:-18,-990 --> 00:-05:-16,-670
The teachers who picked
me up when I was down,

12
00:-05:-16,-670 --> 00:-05:-15,-240
and I didn't believe in myself,

13
00:-05:-15,-240 --> 00:-05:-11,-896
but most importantly, I will
never forget the teachers

14
00:-05:-11,-896 --> 00:-05:-09,-050
who annoyed the f-in' crap outta me.

15
00:-05:-09,-050 --> 00:-05:-07,-270
You Mr. And Mrs. What's yo face?

16
00:-05:-07,-270 --> 00:-05:-06,-238
Guess who's on YouTube?

17
00:-05:-06,-238 --> 00:-05:-05,-180
Just kidding.

18
00:-05:-05,-180 --> 00:-05:-03,-960
No part of that was a joke.

19
00:-05:-03,-960 --> 00:-05:-02,000
Hold me back yo, hold me
back, hold me back yo,

20
00:-05:-02,000 --> 00:-04:-59,-530
so sit back, relax, grab
yourself some popcorn,

21
00:-04:-59,-530 --> 00:-04:-55,-880
and get ready to relate to to
types of teachers at school.

22
00:-04:-55,-880 --> 00:-04:-55,-047
Disclaimer: This is not meant

23
00:-04:-55,-047 --> 00:-04:-53,-040
to generalize all
teachers or be offensive.

24
00:-04:-53,-040 --> 00:-04:-51,-450
Superwoman does not endorse
making fun of teachers.

25
00:-04:-51,-450 --> 00:-04:-49,-980
Any similarities between characters shown

26
00:-04:-49,-980 --> 00:-04:-48,-240
and people in real life
is purely coincidental.

27
00:-04:-48,-240 --> 00:-04:-46,-820
No teachers were harmed in
the making of this video.

28
00:-04:-46,-820 --> 00:-04:-45,-987
Editing makes me hungry.

29
00:-04:-45,-987 --> 00:-04:-44,-980
I like pizza.
I'm going to order some now.

30
00:-04:-44,-980 --> 00:-04:-44,-068
Rainbows.

31
00:-04:-44,-068 --> 00:-04:-43,-070
(banging)
Ow.

32
00:-04:-43,-070 --> 00:-04:-40,-964
Number one, the Lazy Bum.

33
00:-04:-40,-964 --> 00:-04:-39,-520
Honestly, this teacher stopped being

34
00:-04:-39,-520 --> 00:-04:-37,-850
a teacher a long damn time ago.

35
00:-04:-37,-850 --> 00:-04:-36,-240
Is usually found with a fountain drink

36
00:-04:-36,-240 --> 00:-04:-34,-860
or eating snacks during class.

37
00:-04:-34,-860 --> 00:-04:-32,-030
Nothing exciting, nothing
new, noting educational.

38
00:-04:-32,-030 --> 00:-04:-30,-050
On Sumanth if education was taste

39
00:-04:-30,-050 --> 00:-04:-27,-731
this homie's class would be a rice cake.

And honestly, F any teacher
that does peer marking.

58
00:-03:-46,-380 --> 00:-03:-45,-547
You see me?

59
00:-03:-45,-547 --> 00:-03:-43,-343
I'm in a class with my ex
boyfriend, five girls who hate me,

60
00:-03:-43,-343 --> 00:-03:-41,-080
and that kid over there that I
accidentally stepped on okay?

61
00:-03:-41,-080 --> 00:-03:-38,-940
No matter what my answers are, I'ma fail.

62
00:-03:-38,-940 --> 00:-03:-37,-650
Straight up, the class could function

63
00:-03:-37,-650 --> 00:-03:-35,-956
with or without the teacher there.

64
00:-03:-35,-956 --> 00:-03:-33,-939
Teacher! Teacher!

65
00:-03:-33,-939 --> 00:-03:-32,-537

00:-03:-32,-537 --> 00:-03:-31,-660
He put gum in my hair.

67
00:-03:-31,-660 --> 00:-03:-29,-167
Man, can't you just ignore him?

68
00:-03:-26,-150 --> 00:-03:-23,-570
I'm trying to prepare
you for the real world.

69
00:-03:-23,-570 --> 00:-03:-20,-693
Everything, teacher, teacher.

If I was ever stranded in
France, okay, and needed help,

00:-02:-07,-220 --> 00:-02:-05,-100
I would have no idea how to ask for it.

116
00:-01:-57,-330 --> 00:-01:-55,-890

(Speaks French)

123
00:-01:-40,-100 --> 00:-01:-37,-880
Number three, the Kid Eater.

00:-01:-37,-880 --> 00:-01:-36,-700
Story time.

125
00:-01:-36,-700 --> 00:-01:-35,-040
A man and a dog went to the park

126

to go play catch with a stick.

127
00:-01:-33,-590 --> 00:-01:-31,-786
This woman was apparently
standing too close,

128
00:-01:-31,-786 --> 00:-01:-30,-346
when the man threw the stick,

129
00:-01:-30,-346 --> 00:-01:-28,-202
it somehow landed in her bum hole,

130
00:-01:-28,-202 --> 00:-01:-25,-890
and she's been horrendous ever since.

131

00:00:-29,-210 --> 00:00:-27,-150
You better pay attention
to me, okay, you hear me?

168
00:00:-27,-150 --> 00:00:-25,-790
You got this wrong last test.

169
00:00:-25,-790 --> 00:00:-23,-870
You remember last test, when you fail?

170
00:00:-23,-870 --> 00:00:-21,-650
When she failed the last
test, you remember dat Sandra?

171
00:00:-21,-650 --> 00:00:-19,-310
You know why you gettin'
20% on your tests Sandra?

172
00:00:-19,-310 --> 00:00:-17,-963
Because your phone batter on 20%

173
00:00:-17,-963 --> 00:00:-15,-987
'cause you're always using it Sandra.

174
00:00:-15,-987 --> 00:00:-15,-154
Okay.

175
00:00:-15,-154 --> 00:00:-13,-333
Class Sandra thinks that
Temple Run gon pay the bills

176
00:00:-13,-333 --> 00:00:-10,-986

177
00:00:-10,-986 --> 00:00:-10,-070
Sandra?
(crying)

178
00:00:-10,-070 --> 00:00:-07,-237
I'm up here tellin' you something, Sandra.

179
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,720
Number four, the Cool Cat.

180
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,540
This teacher could be male
or female but honestly

181
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:05,620
it don't even matter because they're

182
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:07,280
the coolest teacher ever.

183
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,660
They make learning fun and
you can relate to them.

184
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:10,790
alright class so check it,

185
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:13,013
the reproductive system, let
me break it down for you okay.

186
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,299
Beyonce sends JayZ a text,
and the text is all like,

187
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:19,308
(singing) ♪ tonight I wanna dance for you

188
00:00:19,308 --> 00:00:20,141
(laughs)

189
00:00:20,141 --> 00:00:22,687
and Beyonce gets excited,
her hormones start releasing

190
00:00:22,687 --> 00:00:23,520
you know what I mean?

191
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,576
Her body starts reacting
but she ain't the only one

192
00:00:25,576 --> 00:00:27,740
because her hole text back and is like,

193
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:30,910
give it to me, uh, give
me dat sweet, dat nasty,

194
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:31,743
that good shi stuff,

195
00:00:31,743 --> 00:00:33,620
and now JayZ's body starts reacting,

196
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,250
everone's reacting,
everyone's getting exciting.

197
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,338
Beyonce texts back and is like,

198
00:00:36,338 --> 00:00:40,238
(singing) ♪ I'm feeling sexy,

199
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:43,460
♪ I wanna hear you say my name, yeah ♪

200
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,750
and that's it, JayZ is making
it rain, he's making it rain

201
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,260
but he 'aint makin' it rain dolla bills,

202
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,490
no, no, he's makin' it rain Oxytocin.

203
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:51,282
So now JayZ drinks dat purple drank,

204
00:00:51,282 --> 00:00:54,260
Beyonce brings the fire, now
you got purple, you got red,

205
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:55,840
what happens when you
mix those two together?

206
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,708
You get blue, bam, baby girl, DNA class.

207
00:00:58,708 --> 00:01:00,220
There you have it okay.

208
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:04,547
It's not only up to Beyonce,
JayZ also has the blueprint.

209
00:01:04,547 --> 00:01:06,802
Teaching sex like a boss.

210
00:01:06,802 --> 00:01:09,640
Whaddup t-shirt reference.

211
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,504
Number five, AB Teachers,
aka autobiography teachers.

212
00:01:13,504 --> 00:01:15,780
This teacher teaches
for about five minutes

213
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,430
and then turns the rest of the
class into her autobiography.

214
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:20,830
Like hello, my parents
emotionally scar me enough

215
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,530
at home okay, I don't need to come here

216
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,020
and hear about your damn problems.

217
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:27,010
The rice gets imported from India, class,

218
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:28,330
how many of you have been to India?

219
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:29,862
Yeah I have been to India,

220
00:01:29,862 --> 00:01:32,387
It was about five years
ago, I went to India,

221
00:01:32,387 --> 00:01:33,700
I went with my husband.

222
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,489
You know, that was before
we had kids as well,

223
00:01:36,489 --> 00:01:38,720
a lot changes, you grow apart,

224
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,163
but when I went to India,

225
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:43,690
When I went to india,

226
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:46,140
I remember I rode a rickshaw, a rickshaw,

227
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:46,973
has anyone been on a

228
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:49,390
A rickshaw is basically a wooden car

229
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,336
and a man on a bicycle takes you.

230
00:01:51,336 --> 00:01:55,335
I was terrified of the
rickshaw and of the man,

231
00:01:55,335 --> 00:01:58,200
but my husband gave me his hand

232
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,766
and I was a little bit less
scared, you know, but now,

233
00:02:01,766 --> 00:02:06,307
we don't get to go to places
like India so much anymore,

234
00:02:06,307 --> 00:02:10,094
you know, he's always busy
with work and the drinking,

235
00:02:10,094 --> 00:02:13,870
and I'm busy too you know,
I've got my the class

236
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,418
the students, and the gambling, so.

237
00:02:16,418 --> 00:02:18,601
I'm sorry do I have hair on my head? Okay?

238
00:02:18,601 --> 00:02:21,068
Okay, so I'm not a black man.

239
00:02:21,068 --> 00:02:22,950
Okay so I'm not Maurey?

240
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:23,783
Okay.

241
00:02:23,783 --> 00:02:24,640
And honestly unless your husband

242
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,240
and your kids are on that damn exam,

243
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,520
shut your face, 'cause I know
I'm gonna come in tomorrow

244
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,299
to that exam, look at the
paper, it's gon be asking me

245
00:02:30,299 --> 00:02:32,430
what importing and exporting laws

246
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,860
and F and all I'ma be thinking about

247
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,880
is your damn family matters, so.

248
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,030
Number six, the Weirdo.

249
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,030
This teacher just appears to be crazy.

250
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,900
You can just see the crazy in their eyes.

251
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,260
You ain't sure if you in history class

252
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,582
or Texas Chain Saw Massacre.

253
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:46,600
(chain saw)

254
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,270
They usually makes no sense,
no one understands them.

255
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,860
And they're like a weird
mixture of like, serial killer

256
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,340
and sexually frustrated.

257
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,843
Everything they say sounds
creepy and perverted.

258
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:02,289
okay class, war.
(playful music)

259
00:03:02,289 --> 00:03:04,562
Many wars, very bad.

260
00:03:05,539 --> 00:03:06,483
Bad thing.

261
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,493
Fighting.

262
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,880
Lots fighting.

263
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,427
Blood.
Everywhere blood. You see.

264
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:16,773
Fighting with big guns, fighting.

265
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,427
What kind of gun, big gun.

266
00:03:20,427 --> 00:03:23,960
Very big guns you know, you know?

267
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,953
What guns say? Boom.

268
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:28,863
Boom.

269
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,850
What they say?

270
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,050
What do they say?
Boom.

271
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,300
Like that, yeah.

272
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,240
It looks like they had
a mouth transplant okay,

273
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,560
and their donor was the Grinch.

274
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,220
They make you feel
straight up uncomfortable,

275
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,080
and chances are, years from
now, you're gonna see on

276
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,550
Facebook that they were arrested
for some deranged crime.

277
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,200
To make matters even worse,
they're usually really

278
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,471
monotone but with this like,
slight sense of horror.

279
00:03:49,471 --> 00:03:53,070
It's like, they sound like
Siri, being kidnapped,

280
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:53,903
it's weird.

281
00:03:53,903 --> 00:03:56,266
Homework okay, do in your home.

282
00:03:56,266 --> 00:03:58,187
Where you gon do?
In your home.

283
00:03:58,187 --> 00:04:01,646
I'm going to come and check in your home.

284
00:04:01,646 --> 00:04:03,703
If you're doing my work.

285
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,873
Okay.

286
00:04:09,873 --> 00:04:11,470
